## ✍️ Writing Great Essays

### Title Best Practices

**Do:**
- Keep titles under 60 characters
- Make them descriptive and compelling
- Use action words when appropriate
- Be specific about the topic

**Examples:**
- ✅ "The Rise of African Innovation in FinTech"
- ✅ "How Mobile Money is Transforming Rural Economies"
- ❌ "Essay About Africa" (too vague)
- ❌ "An Extremely Long Title That Goes On Forever And Never Seems To End" (too long)

### Description Writing

The description appears on essay cards. Make it count!

**Guidelines:**
- 150-200 characters ideal
- Summarize the main point
- Create curiosity
- Avoid clickbait

**Example:**
```
"Exploring how Kenya's mobile banking revolution is inspiring 
fintech innovation across the African continent and beyond."
```

### Content Structure

Use HTML tags for formatting:

```html
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Your opening paragraph that hooks the reader...</p>

<h2>Main Point 1</h2>
<p>Supporting details and examples...</p>

<h2>Main Point 2</h2>
<p>More insights and analysis...</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wrap up your thoughts and provide takeaways...</p>
```

### Formatting Tips

**Headings:**
```html
<h2>Section Title</h2>  <!-- Use for main sections -->

```

  <li>Bullet point 2</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Numbered item 1</li>

</ol>
